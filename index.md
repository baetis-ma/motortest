## Motor Testing Fixture Control
<img align="right" width="45%" height="350" src="motortestpage.png"></img>
#####  A project is decribed that provides a test of a motor with a propellor. Features of the setup include:
```
- power relay to the motor ESC power on/off
- current being used by esc
- voltage into esc
- pwm frequency and pulse width to esc control
- measure of rotation speed of motor
- thrust measured by strain guage
- a user interface eith by webpage of curl/netcat commpands
```
##### An esp gpio pin controls the action of a relay module to turn the power going to the ESC module on or off. Power connectors are supplied for either a 12v dc wall transformer power supply or a LiPo 3S cell. Five volts for the esp and its periferals is supplied by 12-5 volt power converter. An ads1115 4 channel adc on an i2c bus monitors the 12v input voltage through a reistance divider and the amount of current used by the system by measuring voltage drop across 0.1 ohm resitor in series with the ESC ground. The pwm control signal to the ESC is generated by the esp-idf mcpwm periferal.

##### The speed of the motor is measured with an obstacle avoidance IR Infrared Sensor Module EK1254 module hooked up to an esp gpio input which triggers interrupts when the reflected light levels changes. The delta time in usec since the last trigger is stored and low pass filtered. The attached photo shows the setup, the sensor module is placed so that ir light bounces off the casing of the motor and is returned to the modules IR detector. A piece of black electrical tape is attached to about a half od the motors case so that when the motor revolves the sensor outputs a zero when the electrical tape is facing it and a one when the IR light relects off the shiny motor casing.

##### I ordered a load cell and two hx711 measurement modules from aliexpress for $3.17, six weeks later I got the package - the load cell had one wire left attached and other less obviuos damage (also only one of the hx711s enclosed). When the white coating was peeled back with a pair of tweasers under a microscope the four places where the wires were attached are plainly visable (see picture to right). When the reisitance was measured between these wires (the loads are resistive so six possibilities) between adjacent leads the resistance was about 1Kohm (except between pin two and three the resistance was 3Kohms), the resistance between pins separated by a pin was 2Kohms. Turns out that the idividual strain resistors in this module have a 1Kohm nominal resitance and are configured as a wheatstone bridge. Inspecting the load cell soon indicated that one of the magnet wires going around an edge of the load cell was frayed and open. The broken wires were pulled up out of the white expoxy and cleaned by heating for 15 seconds in a blob of molten solder and then attached with a short jumper of wirewrap wire. Now the resistances bewteen adjacent pins was 750ohms and opposite pins was 1Kohm, which is what you should expect - a two volt source was attached to opposite pins and the other set of opposite pins was measured the have 0.5mV present, this is also what you would expect on a load cell.

##### The picture above shows the completed load cell after the hx711 module was double sided foam taped in and the necessary jumper wires installed.
##### Couldn't find any code I liked with quick google seach and deceided to write hx711 driver. A good data sheet is available on this part, came up with the following code. The dout pin will go low when conversion is complete and data is ready to be read. The clock is toggled 25 times and data read bit by bit. The 24 bits of data comes out msb first.
```C
#include "esp_timer.h"
#include "rom/ets_sys.h"
float hx711volt, hx711voltlpi = 0;

void hx711_read(float hx711_mv) {
   uint8_t data[4] = {0,0,0,0};
   while(gpio_get_level(GPIO_KX711_DOUT) == 1){
      printf("waiting\n");
      vTaskDelay(10);
   }
   for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
      gpio_set_level(GPIO_KX711_SCK, 1);
      ets_delay_us(10);
      if(gpio_get_level(GPIO_KX711_DOUT) == 1) data[i/8] |= (1 << (7-(i%8)));
      gpio_set_level(GPIO_KX711_SCK, 0);
      ets_delay_us(10);
   }
   hx711volt = 20*(float)(16777216*data[0]+65536*data[1]+256*data[2]+data[3])/(1ULL<<31);
   hx711voltlp = 0.9 hx711voltlp + 0.1 * hx711volt;
   //printf("%8.5fmv\n", hx711voltlp);
   return(hx711voltlp);
}
```
##### The loadcell measurement does not seem to drift much over time, are very stable when just sitting there and sports few maverics. Mine calibrated out to 2.8uV/gram. The 1kg load cell that was tested appears that it might be accurate down to better than 0.1g, this was not tested very much becase on this project we are only looking for in the range of 10g accuracy.

##### The webpage shot to the up at the top shows the responce and control fields assisting this test. The webpage is loaded when browser requests the url `192.168.0.106/index.html` and remains resident in broswer till exited. The index.html embeds javascript code that responds to actions initiated by the user clicking or entering action fields on the browser display and in responce generates a tcp packet with a resource field of `GET /trfData?vout=0x40+pwm=1222+freq=50+onoff=0`. The javascript responds to the return packet from the esp in the form `data,3.0960,3.8640,4.6320,5.4000,0.000000,inf,`, this is the data being collected from ADCs and a pulse counter on the esp, the javascript parses this data and updates the diplay with rev/min, power, voltage and weight measurements. The javascript also repeats the current request every few seconds in order to keep the data section of the webpage current, the stability of the measurement is is about 0.1uV or a tenth of a gram of a gram.
##### Using curl commands in a shell (or perl) script allows programmatic control of motor testing, where the pwm can be adjusted upward slowly and the motor speed, motor power and generated thrust can be saved to a file and studied with gnuplot afterward.
##### This project sets up a simple tcp socket with enough functionality to serve up a stand-alone .html file and handle bi-directional data flow between the esp device and the browser.
##### The tcp_server_task in the esp takes the incoming IP packets combines, windows, verifies/requests retransmission, and notifies us that an http request is ready. When I filled 192.168.0.122/index.html into my browser address bar window the contents of the tcp server (running over in my esp running a wifi connection at IP adrress 192.168.0.122) receive buffer were:
```

##### A curl or netcat command from a terminal any where on same lan as the esp can issue same request
```

```
##### will respond with

```
##### A perl program sent out curl commands and received the javascript resonce with raw ADC and pulse with mesurements. The perl program time stamped the reciept (relative to unix epoch even), calculated current by dividing measured voltage divided by 0.1 ohms, calculated battery voltage from output voltage after resistor divider and the rps from the pulse width. The outputs were stored in a table and examined with gnuplot.

## Setting up
##### Another earlier repository https://baetis-ma.github.io/esp32-idf-website/ goes through setting up another very similar project with out the javascript. It describes a lot of the isoftware setup and function of a project similar enough to this project do not get repeated here. 
##### I am hoping to get some quality characterization data from the 30A esc-A2212/13T 10000KV motors-1045 propellers system in the hopes of writting a simulation program for my drone, but we'll see how that goes.
